# psycopg3 Migration Analysis & Implementation Plan
## APES - Adaptive Prompt Enhancement System

**Analysis Date:** January 2025  
**Current Status:** Partial psycopg3 implementation with missing dependencies  
**Migration Risk:** LOW - Hybrid architecture already optimal

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** The APES codebase has already partially migrated to psycopg3 with an optimal hybrid architecture, but is missing proper dependencies and 2025 optimizations.

**Current Architecture:**
- ✅ **SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg** for ORM operations (optimal)
- ✅ **psycopg3 + AsyncConnectionPool** for high-performance operations (good design)
- ❌ **Missing psycopg3 dependencies** (critical issue)
- ❌ **Unused psycopg2-binary dependency** (cleanup needed)

**Migration Outcome:** Low-risk dependency fixes and performance optimizations, not a complete rewrite.

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Architecture Assessment: ✅ EXCELLENT

The codebase uses a **hybrid database architecture** that's actually superior to pure psycopg3:

```python
# Current: SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg for ORM operations
class DatabaseSessionManager:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str):
        self._engine = create_async_engine(database_url)  # Uses asyncpg
        self._sessionmaker = async_sessionmaker(bind=self._engine)

# Current: psycopg3 for high-performance operations
class TypeSafePsycopgClient:
    def __init__(self, config: DatabaseConfig):
        self.pool = AsyncConnectionPool(
            conninfo=self.conninfo,
            min_size=config.pool_min_size,
            max_size=config.pool_max_size,
            kwargs={"row_factory": dict_row, "prepare_threshold": 5}
        )
```

### Dependency Analysis: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE

| Package | Current Status | Required Action |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| `psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10` | ❌ Present but unused | Remove completely |
| `psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.1.0` | ❌ Missing | Add to requirements |
| `psycopg_pool>=3.1.0` | ❌ Missing | Add to requirements |

### Code Analysis: ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

```python
# Found in src/prompt_improver/database/psycopg_client.py
from psycopg.rows import dict_row
from psycopg_pool import AsyncConnectionPool

class TypeSafePsycopgClient:
    """High-performance type-safe database client using psycopg3"""
    # Already implements 2025 best practices:
    # - AsyncConnectionPool with proper configuration
    # - dict_row for structured data
    # - Performance monitoring with QueryMetrics
    # - Pydantic integration for type safety
    # - Query preparation (prepare_threshold=5)
```

**Key Insight:** The psycopg3 implementation is already in place and follows many 2025 best practices, but cannot run due to missing dependencies.

## 🔍 Migration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dependency Conflicts
**Issue:** psycopg2 and psycopg3 cannot coexist in the same environment.

**Solution:** 
```bash
# Remove conflicting dependency
pip uninstall psycopg2-binary

# Add psycopg3 dependencies
pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.1.0"
```

### Challenge 2: Import Changes
**Issue:** Different import patterns between psycopg2 and psycopg3.

**Status:** ✅ Already resolved - existing code uses correct psycopg3 imports.

### Challenge 3: Breaking Changes
**Issue:** API differences between psycopg2 and psycopg3.

**Status:** ✅ Not applicable - no direct psycopg2 usage found in codebase.

---

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Migration (Priority: HIGH, Risk: LOW)

**Goal:** Fix missing dependencies and remove conflicts.

**Tasks:**
1. **Remove psycopg2-binary** from `requirements.txt`
2. **Add psycopg3 dependencies**:
   ```
   psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.1.0
   ```
3. **Update pyproject.toml** if needed
4. **Test existing psycopg3 code** works with new dependencies

**Expected Outcome:** Existing `TypeSafePsycopgClient` becomes functional.

### Phase 2: 2025 Optimizations (Priority: MEDIUM, Risk: LOW)

**Goal:** Enhance existing psycopg3 implementation with modern features.

**Connection Optimizations:**
```python
# Enhanced connection parameters
class EnhancedPsycopgClient:
    def __init__(self, config: DatabaseConfig):
        self.pool = AsyncConnectionPool(
            conninfo=self.conninfo,
            min_size=config.pool_min_size,
            max_size=config.pool_max_size,
            timeout=config.pool_timeout,
            max_lifetime=config.pool_max_lifetime,
            kwargs={
                "row_factory": dict_row,
                "prepare_threshold": 5,
                "autocommit": False,
                # 2025 Enhancements:
                "application_name": "apes_production",
                "timezone": "UTC",
                "server_settings": {
                    "shared_preload_libraries": "pg_stat_statements"
                }
            }
        )
```

**Server-side Binding:**
```python
# Implement explicit server-side binding for performance
async def execute_with_server_binding(
    self, query: str, params: dict[str, Any]
) -> int:
    """Execute with server-side parameter binding for better performance"""
    async with self.connection() as conn:
        # psycopg3 uses server-side binding by default
        async with conn.cursor() as cur:
            await cur.execute(query, params)
            return cur.rowcount
```

**Pipeline Mode:**
```python
# Implement pipeline mode for batch operations
async def execute_pipeline(
    self, operations: list[tuple[str, dict]]
) -> list[Any]:
    """Execute multiple operations in pipeline mode"""
    async with self.connection() as conn:
        async with conn.pipeline() as pipe:
            results = []
            for query, params in operations:
                cur = pipe.cursor()
                await cur.execute(query, params)
                results.append(await cur.fetchall())
            return results
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Priority: LOW, Risk: LOW)

**COPY Operations:**
```python
# Implement COPY operations for bulk data
async def copy_from_csv(
    self, table: str, csv_data: str, columns: list[str]
) -> int:
    """Bulk insert from CSV using COPY"""
    async with self.connection() as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cur:
            with cur.copy(f"COPY {table} ({','.join(columns)}) FROM STDIN WITH CSV") as copy:
                await copy.write(csv_data)
            return cur.rowcount
```

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
```python
# Add comprehensive pool monitoring
class PoolMonitor:
    def __init__(self, pool: AsyncConnectionPool):
        self.pool = pool
    
    async def get_pool_stats(self) -> dict:
        """Get detailed pool statistics"""
        return {
            "size": self.pool.size,
            "available": self.pool.available,
            "waiting": self.pool.waiting,
            "max_size": self.pool.max_size,
            "min_size": self.pool.min_size,
            "total_connections": self.pool.get_stats().get("total_connections", 0),
            "active_connections": self.pool.get_stats().get("active_connections", 0)
        }
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Priority: HIGH, Risk: LOW)

**Test Strategy:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Verify all psycopg3 functionality
2. **Integration Tests:** Test with existing SQLAlchemy operations
3. **Performance Tests:** Benchmark improvements
4. **Regression Tests:** Ensure no existing functionality breaks

**Test Example:**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_psycopg3_migration():
    """Test that psycopg3 client works correctly"""
    config = DatabaseConfig()
    
    async with TypeSafePsycopgClient(config) as client:
        # Test basic operations
        result = await client.execute("SELECT 1")
        assert result == 1
        
        # Test type-safe operations
        models = await client.fetch_models(
            TestModel, "SELECT * FROM test_table"
        )
        assert all(isinstance(m, TestModel) for m in models)
        
        # Test performance
        start = time.time()
        await client.execute("SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 1000")
        duration = time.time() - start
        assert duration < 0.050  # <50ms target
```

2. **No Breaking Changes:** Main operations use SQLAlchemy + asyncpg
3. **Hybrid Architecture:** Best of both worlds approach
4. **Incremental Migration:** Can be done in phases

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Occur:**
1. **Revert dependencies:** Add psycopg2-binary back, remove psycopg3
2. **Disable psycopg3 client:** Fall back to SQLAlchemy-only operations
3. **Gradual rollout:** Test in development/staging first

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Query Performance | <50ms p95 | Query timing metrics |
| Connection Pool Health | >95% availability | Pool monitoring |
| Error Rate | <1% | Exception tracking |
| Memory Usage | <256MB per worker | Resource monitoring |
