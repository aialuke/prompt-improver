"""Direct Python ML integration service for Phase 3 continuous learning.
Replaces cross-language bridge architecture with direct Python function calls.
Performance improvement: 50-100ms â†’ 1-5ms response times.

Enhanced with production model registry, alias-based deployment, and Apriori pattern discovery.

Modern ML architecture using focused, single-responsibility services:
- MLModelRegistry: Model caching and memory management
- MLTrainingService: Model training and optimization
- MLInferenceService: Model predictions and inference
- MLProductionService: Production deployment and monitoring
- MLPatternDiscoveryService: Pattern discovery and analysis
- MLOrchestrationAdapter: Orchestrator integration
