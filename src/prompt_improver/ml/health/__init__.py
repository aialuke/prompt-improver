"""
ML Health Monitoring Infrastructure - 2025 Best Practices

This module provides comprehensive health monitoring for ML models and inference systems:
- Real-time model loading status and memory tracking
- Inference latency measurement with detailed percentile metrics  
- Model drift detection through prediction distribution analysis
- GPU/CPU resource utilization monitoring
- Model version tracking and registry integration
- Memory leak detection and optimization
- Prediction success/failure rate monitoring

Integrates with the existing PromptImprover health check system for unified monitoring.
