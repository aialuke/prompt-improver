"""Cache service package with decomposed multi-level cache architecture.

This package provides a clean separation of concerns for the multi-level caching system:
- L1CacheService: In-memory cache with <1ms response time
- L2CacheService: Redis cache with 1-10ms response time  
- L3CacheService: Database cache with 10-50ms response time
- CacheCoordinatorService: Multi-level coordination and optimization
- CacheServiceFacade: Unified interface maintaining <200ms overall response time

Designed to achieve >80% cache hit rates and sub-200ms response times.
