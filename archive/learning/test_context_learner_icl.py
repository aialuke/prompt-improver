"""Tests for Phase 2 In-Context Learning implementation in Context-Specific Learning.

Comprehensive test suite for in-context learning enhancements including:
- Demonstration selection and retrieval
- Contextual bandit Thompson Sampling
- Differential privacy preservation
- Privacy-preserving personalization
- Integration with existing context learning workflow

Testing best practices applied from Context7 research and 2025 ICL testing standards:
- Proper async testing with pytest-asyncio
- Statistical validation of ML components with real behavior
- Normalization verification for neural network inputs
- Real behavior testing with authentic ML components
- Progressive testing with realistic data ranges and metamorphic validation
