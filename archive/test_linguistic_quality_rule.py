"""
Unit tests for LinguisticQualityRule.
"""

# Migrated from mock-based testing to real behavior testing following 2025 best practices:
# - Use real NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob) for authentic linguistic analysis
# - Test actual linguistic processing rather than implementation details
# - Validate real metrics like readability scores, entity extraction results
# - Mock only external dependencies, not core NLP functionality
# - Use real text samples for authentic testing scenarios
