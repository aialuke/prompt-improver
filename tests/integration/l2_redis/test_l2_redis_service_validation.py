"""Comprehensive L2RedisService validation with real Redis testcontainers.

This test suite validates all simplifications made to L2RedisService during
aggressive code compression, ensuring no functionality regression and that
performance targets (<10ms) are maintained.

Critical validation areas:
1. Simplified close() method - graceful connection cleanup
2. Performance tracking helper consolidation - _track_operation() accuracy
3. Connection management simplification - recovery and error handling
4. Real Redis behavior under various failure scenarios
5. Performance target compliance (<10ms response times)
