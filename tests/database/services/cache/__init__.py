"""Tests for cache management services.

This package contains comprehensive tests for the multi-level cache architecture:

Real Behavior Testing:
    - No mocks for core functionality
    - Actual Redis instances for L2 cache tests  
    - Real database connections for L3 cache tests
    - End-to-end cache warming scenarios

Performance Testing:
    - Cache hit/miss ratios under load
    - Multi-level cache coordination efficiency
    - Memory usage and eviction behavior
    - Concurrent access patterns

Integration Testing:
    - Cross-level cache consistency
    - Failover scenarios between cache levels
    - Security context validation
    - OpenTelemetry metrics integration

Unit Testing:
    - Individual cache component behavior
    - Access pattern tracking algorithms
    - Cache entry lifecycle management
    - Warming priority calculations
