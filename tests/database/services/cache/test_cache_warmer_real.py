"""Real behavior tests for Cache Warmer.

Tests intelligent cache warming with real access patterns:
- Predictive warming algorithm accuracy
- Background warming process efficiency  
- Resource usage monitoring during warming
- Integration with access pattern tracking
- Multi-level warming coordination
- Priority-based warming validation

Tests real warming scenarios with actual cache backends.
