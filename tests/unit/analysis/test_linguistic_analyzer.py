"""
Integration tests for LinguisticAnalyzer class.
Following 2025 best practices: real behavior testing, feature-focused, minimal mocking.

This test suite follows the 2025 testing philosophy:
- "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration." (Kent C. Dodds)
- Tests focus on complete features rather than isolated functions
- Uses real LinguisticAnalyzer instances with production-like behavior
- Mocks only external dependencies (if any)
- Tests actual text processing and analysis workflows
