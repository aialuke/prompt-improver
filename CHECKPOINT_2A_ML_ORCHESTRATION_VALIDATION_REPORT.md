### 🔧 Recommended Fixes

```python
# Fix 1: AdaptiveEventBus worker reference
# In _scale_workers method, line 409:
current_count = len(self.worker_task_ids)  # Use worker_task_ids instead of worker_tasks

# Fix 2: Task priority handling
# Add priority type conversion in task submission
if isinstance(priority, str):
    priority = TaskPriority[priority.upper()]
```
