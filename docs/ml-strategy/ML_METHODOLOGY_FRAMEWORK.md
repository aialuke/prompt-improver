# ML Methodology Framework

**Document Purpose:** Foundational research-based approach for machine learning improvements  
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2025  
**Source:** Extracted from ALGORITHM_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP_v2.md

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes production-grade methodology from machine learning best practices to achieve **statistically validated 8-15% improvement** through systematic evaluation infrastructure, rigorous error analysis, and continuous monitoring.

**Key Achievement:** Moved from **1.2% real improvement** vs **21.9% simulated improvement** to a systematic approach based on Context7 Research: scikit-learn, MLflow, and Statsig A/B Testing Best Practices.

## Research-Based Methodology Framework

### ðŸ”¬ **Scientific Approach (Following ML Best Practices)**

#### Core Principles

- **Evaluation Infrastructure First**: Build measurement tools before algorithm changes
- **Statistical Rigor**: Cross-validation, bootstrap confidence intervals, sequential testing
- **Error Analysis**: Bottom-up examination of actual failure modes vs top-down assumptions
- **Capability Funnel**: Infrastructure â†’ Analysis â†’ Optimization â†’ Deployment
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with drift detection

#### Implementation Philosophy

1. **Measurement Before Optimization**: No algorithmic changes without robust evaluation infrastructure
2. **Statistical Significance**: All claims must be backed by rigorous statistical testing
3. **Real-World Validation**: Simulation results must be validated against real performance
4. **Systematic Error Analysis**: Bottom-up investigation of failure modes

### ðŸ“Š **Validation Standards (scikit-learn methodology)**

#### Statistical Requirements

- All improvements must show **p < 0.05 statistical significance**
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals** for all performance metrics (minimum 1000 iterations)
- **Cross-validation** with stratified sampling across domains (minimum 5-fold)
- **Multiple comparison correction** (Bonferroni/FDR) for multiple tests
- **Power analysis** to determine required sample sizes (minimum 80% power)

#### Quality Gates

1. **Significance Testing**: Paired t-tests for before/after comparisons
2. **Effect Size**: Cohen's d calculation with practical significance thresholds
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap CIs for all reported metrics
4. **Cross-Validation**: Stratified sampling to ensure domain representation
5. **Multiple Comparisons**: Correction for family-wise error rate

### ðŸŽ¯ **Research Integration Standards**

#### Context7 Research Application

- **scikit-learn Best Practices**: Statistical validation, cross-validation methodology
- **MLflow Production Patterns**: Experiment tracking, model management, deployment pipelines
- **Statsig A/B Testing**: Sequential testing, statistical power analysis, bias correction

#### Academic Rigor

- **Pre-registered Hypotheses**: All tests defined before data collection
- **Reproducible Research**: Version control for data, code, and experiments
- **Peer Review Process**: Internal validation of methodology and results
- **Publication Standards**: Documentation meets academic publication quality
