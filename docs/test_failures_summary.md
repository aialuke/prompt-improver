## Overview

This document outlines the findings from the recent test run in the `APES` project. The test execution revealed several critical issues and areas that need addressing to ensure tests pass successfully.

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests Collected**: 248  
**Total Passed**: 206  
**Total Failed**: 41  
**Total Skipped**: 1

## Major Issue Categories

### 1. Database Schema Issues

- **Missing `ml_optimized` Column**: Many tests are failing due to the absence of this column in the `userfeedback` table.

### 2. Missing Dependencies

- **psutil Module**: Required for system resource health checks is not installed.
- **Missing Attributes**:
  - `improve_prompt` attribute is missing in health checkers module.

### 3. Prometheus Metrics Context Manager Issues

- `TypeError`: Context manager protocol issue in `metrics.py` at line 125, indicating improper use of a context manager.

### 4. Database Model/Import Issues

- Missing attributes like `MLModelPerformance`, `ABExperiment`, `DiscoveredPattern`.
- `TypeError`: 'RulePerformance' object is not subscriptable.

### 5. Hypothesis Testing Issues

- **Deadline Exceeded**: Multiple tests are taking too long.
- **ML Optimization NaN Values**: Failures due to unaccepted `NaN` values.

### 6. Database Constraint Violations

- Unique constraint violations and check constraint violations impacting several tests.

## Priority Fixes Needed

1. **Database Migration**: Add missing `ml_optimized` column to `userfeedback`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Include the `psutil` package and ensure proper imports.
3. **Fix Metrics Context Manager**: Resolve context manager issue.
4. **Update Database Models**: Add missing model attributes and classes.
5. **Implement Health Checker Fixes**: Ensure required attributes are defined.
6. **Test Data and Configuration**: Adjust to avoid unique and check constraint violations.
