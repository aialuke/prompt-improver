# Archive Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains historical documentation and archived artifacts from the APES (Adaptive Prompt Enhancement System) project development. These materials provide context for past development phases and serve as a historical record of the project's evolution.

## Directory Structure

## Archive Categories

### Phase-Based Archives
- **baselines/**: Initial project baseline documentation and setup artifacts
- **verification/**: Phase 1 verification and validation documentation
- **refactoring/**: Phase 4 refactoring plans and implementation records
- **closure/**: Phase 8 project closure and finalization documentation

### Historical Documents
- **ALGORITHM_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md**: Original algorithm improvement planning document
- **ALGORITHM_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP_v2.md**: Updated algorithm improvement roadmap
- **pivot_v2.md**: Project pivot documentation and strategic changes

## Purpose and Usage

### Historical Context
These archived documents provide:
- Development timeline and decision history
- Evolution of project requirements and scope
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Lessons learned from each development phase

### Reference Material
Archived materials serve as:
- Reference for understanding current system design
- Context for future development decisions
- Documentation of what has been tried and outcomes
- Audit trail for project evolution

### Research and Analysis
Historical documents support:
- Post-mortem analysis of development phases
- Research into effective development practices
- Understanding of technical debt and its origins
- Planning for future similar projects

## Access Guidelines

### When to Reference Archives
- Understanding the reasoning behind current system design
- Planning major changes or refactoring efforts
- Conducting project retrospectives
- Onboarding new team members to project history

### Archive Maintenance
- Archives should be read-only to preserve historical integrity
- Updates should only be made to correct factual errors
- New historical documents should be added when phases complete
- Regular review to ensure archives remain organized and accessible

## Archive Policy

### Retention
- All phase-based documentation is retained permanently
- Historical roadmaps and planning documents are preserved
- Technical artifacts are archived when they become obsolete
- Decision logs and rationale documents are maintained indefinitely

### Organization
- Archives are organized by development phase when possible
- Documents are grouped by type (planning, implementation, analysis)
- Clear naming conventions distinguish archived from active documents
- Regular reorganization maintains logical structure as project evolves
