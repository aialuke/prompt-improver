### Implementation Gap Analysis
**What Exists:**
- 📄 Simulation data in `production-expert-dataset-results.json`
- 🏗️ Some database schema fields for statistical data
- 📚 Comprehensive research via Context7 on Label Studio best practices

**What's Missing:**
- 🚫 No `/src/production/` directory
- 🚫 No expert recruitment system
- 🚫 No annotation interface integration
- 🚫 No statistical reliability calculations
- 🚫 No quality control mechanisms
- 🚫 No Label Studio integration

## Expert Recruitment Process

### Qualification Requirements
1. **Domain Expertise**: Demonstrable experience in target domains
2. **Annotation Experience**: Previous experience with structured evaluation
3. **Quality Consistency**: Performance on golden task validation
4. **Time Availability**: Commitment to annotation timeline
5. **Communication**: Clear understanding of annotation guidelines

### Quality Validation Pipeline
```javascript
class ExpertQualityValidator {
  async validateExpert(expertId, annotationSet) {
    // Golden task accuracy assessment
    const goldenTaskAccuracy = this.assessGoldenTaskAccuracy(expertId);
    
    // Inter-rater reliability calculation
    const reliability = this.calculateInterRaterReliability(expertId);
    
    // Consistency over time analysis
    const consistency = this.assessConsistencyOverTime(expertId);
    
    // Overall quality gate decision
    return this.makeQualityGateDecision({
      goldenTaskAccuracy,
      reliability,
      consistency
    });
  }
}
```

## Data Collection Methodology

### Stratified Sampling Strategy
- **Domain Distribution**: Equal representation across 5 domains
- **Complexity Levels**: Balanced simple/medium/complex prompts
- **Use Case Coverage**: Various prompt types and contexts
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple experts per prompt for validation

### Annotation Guidelines
1. **Clarity Assessment**: Evaluate prompt clarity and comprehensibility
2. **Completeness Evaluation**: Assess information completeness
3. **Specificity Rating**: Rate level of detail and precision
4. **Actionability Score**: Evaluate practical implementability
5. **Overall Quality**: Holistic quality assessment

### Quality Control Measures
- **Golden Tasks**: 15% of dataset with known correct answers
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous quality assessment
- **Expert Pausing**: Automatic suspension for quality issues
- **Feedback Loops**: Iterative improvement through feedback
