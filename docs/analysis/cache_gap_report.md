# Cache Gap Analysis Report

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of the current caching architecture, identifying areas where additional caching could reduce latency and improve performance.

## Existing Caching Mechanisms
- **ModelManager**: Utilizes an in-memory caching mechanism with features like memory optimization, model quantization, and device mapping. Caches models based on configuration keys with a TTL of 1 hour, optimized for approximately 100MB data size.
- **PromptImprovementService**: Implements a rule cache with a TTL of 5 minutes using multi-armed bandit optimization for intelligent rule selection. Typical cache size is small, focused on rule metadata.
- **WebSocketManager**: Utilizes Redis for pub/sub to manage real-time data broadcasting to WebSocket connections, enabling scalable real-time analytics. Redis cache typically handles high-throughput messages efficiently.

### Redis Usage
Active in WebSocketManager for pub/sub patterns. It's essential to monitor slow logs and keyspace events to ensure real-time performance is maintained.

### Rule Loading
Rules are dynamically loaded and cached, prioritized based on database-driven configurations. Effective caching here reduces unnecessary database hits, primarily affecting read access latency.
