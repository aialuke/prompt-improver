# Claude Code Agent Architecture Analysis

## Current System Overview

### Agent Ecosystem
The prompt-improver project currently implements a sophisticated Claude Code subagent system with 5 specialized agents:

1. **database-specialist** (cyan)
2. **ml-orchestrator** (purple)
3. **performance-engineer** (green)
4. **security-architect** (red)
5. **infrastructure-specialist** (blue)

## Agent Interaction Matrix

### Current Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Primary Domain | Secondary Domains | Tools Integration |
|-------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **database-specialist** | Schema design, migrations, PostgreSQL optimization | Query performance, connection pooling | Limited (general tools) |
| **ml-orchestrator** | ML pipelines, model training, MLOps | Model optimization, distributed training | Limited (general tools) |
| **performance-engineer** | Bottleneck analysis, monitoring setup | Database query optimization, ML performance | Limited (general tools) |
| **security-architect** | Authentication, authorization, vulnerability assessment | Cryptography, secure coding | Limited (general tools) |
| **infrastructure-specialist** | Development environments, testcontainers, CI/CD | Infrastructure monitoring setup | Limited (general tools) |

### Role Overlap Analysis

#### Identified Overlaps:
1. **Database Performance**: 
   - database-specialist: Query optimization, indexing
   - performance-engineer: Database query profiling, optimization
   
2. **ML Performance**:
   - ml-orchestrator: Model optimization, training performance
   - performance-engineer: ML component performance, resource optimization

3. **Security Infrastructure**:
   - security-architect: Security policies, threat assessment
   - infrastructure-specialist: Security infrastructure setup

4. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - performance-engineer: Performance monitoring and dashboards
   - infrastructure-specialist: Monitoring infrastructure setup

## Current Tool Integration

### Permissions System
The system implements extensive permissions via `settings.local.json` with 198+ allowed tool patterns including:
- Database operations (PostgreSQL, migration scripts)
- Python/ML operations (pytest, ML testing, model imports)
- Development tools (npm, docker, git)
- MCP tool integrations
- Web fetch capabilities for documentation

### MCP Server Integration
**Current Status**: Configured but underutilized
- `mcp_servers.json` exists but is empty (`{}`)
- External tools documentation mentions Voyage AI semantic search (extracted to standalone)
- Context7 integration active for library documentation
- Memory tools for knowledge management
- Sequential thinking tools for complex reasoning

### Governance Hooks
**Async Governance Validator** (`async-governance-validator.py`):
- Enforces Unified Async Infrastructure Protocol
- Blocks `asyncio.create_task()` violations
- Allows legitimate patterns (tests, parallel execution, framework internals)
- Currently applies to Write, Edit, MultiEdit operations

## Current Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Agent Definitions**: Each agent has detailed system prompts with specific methodologies
2. **Clear Example Scenarios**: Rich examples for agent delegation decisions
3. **Sophisticated Permission System**: Granular control over tool access
4. **Quality Governance**: Pre-tool hooks for code quality enforcement
5. **Modern Architecture Focus**: Emphasis on 2025 patterns and real behavior testing
6. **Project-Specific Customization**: Tailored to ML/analytics domain

## Current Weaknesses

1. **Role Boundary Overlaps**: Unclear delegation between related domains
2. **Underutilized MCP Integration**: Empty MCP server configuration
3. **Limited Project-Specific Knowledge**: Agents lack deep codebase integration
4. **Missing Specialized Domains**: Gaps in API design, monitoring, testing strategy
5. **Basic Governance Hooks**: Limited to async patterns only

## Integration Opportunities

### Existing Codebase Patterns
The project demonstrates sophisticated architecture that agents could leverage:
- **Clean Architecture**: Repository patterns, protocol-based DI
- **Service Facades**: Unified interfaces with internal component specialization
- **Multi-Level Caching**: L1 Memory + L2 Redis + L3 Database
- **Real Behavior Testing**: Testcontainers integration
- **SLO Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry, performance tracking
- **Unified Security**: Comprehensive security component architecture

### MCP Server Integration Potential
- **PostgreSQL MCP**: Direct database operations and query optimization
- **GitHub MCP**: Issue tracking, PR management, code analysis
- **OpenTelemetry MCP**: Monitoring and observability integration
- **Documentation MCP**: Technical documentation and API doc management

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Complete role boundary analysis and optimization
2. **Phase 2**: Activate MCP server integrations
3. **Phase 3**: Add 6 new specialized agents for missing domains
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate agents with project-specific patterns
5. **Phase 5**: Enhance governance and quality systems
