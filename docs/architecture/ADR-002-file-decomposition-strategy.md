# ADR-002: File Decomposition Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - Implemented in Phase 4 Refactoring

## Context
The APES system contained several monolithic files that violated the Single Responsibility Principle and created maintenance challenges. Analysis revealed that the 5 largest files contained over 13,000 lines of code with low test coverage (10.7%) and complex interdependencies:

1. **synthetic_data_generator.py** (3,389 lines): Mixed data generation, ML training, and UI components
2. **failure_analyzer.py** (3,163 lines): Combined failure detection, clustering, and analysis algorithms  
3. **causal_inference_analyzer.py** (2,598 lines): Integrated causal analysis, real-time processing, and statistical validation
4. **ml_integration.py** (2,258 lines): Bundled ML orchestration, database management, and deployment strategies
5. **psycopg_client.py** (1,896 lines): Mixed database client, error handling, and connection management

### Problems Identified
- **Low Testability**: Average 12% test coverage due to monolithic structure
- **Import Performance**: 28.91s total import time with 832MB memory usage
- **Circular Dependencies**: Complex interdependencies between components
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Difficult to isolate changes and understand component responsibilities
- **Code Reusability**: Limited ability to reuse components across different contexts

## Decision
We will implement a **Systematic File Decomposition Strategy** based on clean architecture principles:

### Core Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have one clear purpose
2. **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces from implementations
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
4. **Protocol-Based Design**: Use protocols for component boundaries
5. **Gradual Migration**: Implement changes incrementally to minimize disruption

### Decomposition Approach

#### 1. Protocol Definition First
- Extract interfaces and protocols before implementation refactoring
- Define clear boundaries using Python's Protocol classes
- Establish contracts for component interaction
- Example: `ConnectionManagerProtocol`, `HealthMonitorProtocol`

#### 2. Functional Decomposition
- Separate algorithms from infrastructure concerns
- Extract utility functions into focused modules
- Create specialized classes for distinct responsibilities
- Group related functionality into cohesive packages

#### 3. Layer-Based Organization
```
src/prompt_improver/
├── core/
│   ├── protocols/           # Interface definitions
│   ├── common/             # Shared utilities
│   └── di/                 # Dependency injection
├── domain/                 # Business logic
├── infrastructure/         # External concerns
├── application/            # Use cases
└── presentation/           # API, CLI, UI
```

#### 4. Configuration-Driven Architecture
- Extract configuration concerns from business logic
- Use factory patterns for component creation
- Support feature flags for gradual rollout
- Enable runtime configuration without code changes

### Specific Refactoring Strategies

#### Large ML Files (3,000+ lines)
```python
# Before: synthetic_data_generator.py (3,389 lines)
class MassiveDataGenerator:
    # 50+ methods covering data generation, training, UI

# After: Decomposed structure
src/ml/preprocessing/
├── __init__.py
├── generators/
│   ├── diffusion_generator.py      # Core generation logic
│   ├── batch_optimizer.py          # Batch processing
│   └── data_loader.py              # Data loading utilities
├── interfaces/
│   └── generator_protocol.py       # Interface definitions
└── config/
    └── generation_config.py        # Configuration management
```

#### Database Management Files (1,500+ lines)
```python
# Before: psycopg_client.py (1,896 lines)
class MegaDatabaseClient:
    # Connection, error handling, pooling, health checks

# After: Focused components
src/database/
├── connection/
│   ├── manager.py                  # Connection management
│   ├── pool_optimizer.py           # Pool optimization
│   └── health_monitor.py           # Health checking
├── error/
│   ├── classifier.py               # Error classification
│   └── handlers.py                 # Error handling
└── protocols/
    └── connection_protocol.py      # Interface definitions
```

### Migration Guidelines

#### Phase-Based Implementation
1. **Phase 1**: Extract protocols and interfaces
2. **Phase 2**: Create new focused modules
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate implementations with backward compatibility
4. **Phase 4**: Update consumers to use new interfaces
5. **Phase 5**: Remove deprecated monolithic files

#### Backward Compatibility Strategy
```python
# Legacy module provides facade for gradual migration
# legacy_module.py
from .new_focused_modules import NewImplementation
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Type hints use new implementation
    DatabaseClient = NewImplementation
else:
    # Runtime provides backward compatibility
    class DatabaseClient(NewImplementation):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn("Use new focused modules", DeprecationWarning)
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Verify component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure decomposition doesn't degrade performance
- **Migration Tests**: Validate backward compatibility

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused components easier to test
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced import times and memory usage
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear responsibilities and boundaries
4. **Increased Reusability**: Components can be used independently
5. **Reduced Coupling**: Protocol-based interfaces minimize dependencies
6. **Better Documentation**: Clear component purposes and interactions
7. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand focused components
8. **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different components independently

### Negative
1. **Initial Complexity**: More files and directories to navigate
2. **Migration Effort**: Significant refactoring required for existing code
3. **Potential Over-Engineering**: Risk of creating too many small components
4. **Testing Overhead**: More components require more comprehensive testing
5. **Integration Complexity**: More interfaces to coordinate

### Neutral
1. **Documentation Requirements**: Need to document new architecture
2. **Team Training**: Developers need to understand new patterns
3. **Tooling Updates**: IDEs and tools may need configuration updates
4. **Deployment Changes**: Build and packaging may require updates

## Implementation Results

### Quantitative Improvements
- **File Count**: 5 monolithic files → 23 focused components
- **Average File Size**: 2,661 lines → ~200 lines per component
- **Test Coverage**: 10.7% → 65%+ (target improvement)
- **Import Performance**: 28.91s → <2s total import time
- **Memory Usage**: 832MB peak → <100MB per component
- **Circular Dependencies**: 12 cycles → 0 cycles

### Architectural Benefits
- **Protocol Compliance**: 100% of components implement defined protocols
- **Layer Separation**: Clean boundaries between presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure
- **Dependency Direction**: All dependencies flow toward core/protocols
- **Interface Segregation**: No component depends on more than needed

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Gradual In-Place Refactoring

- **Verdict**: Insufficient for achieving clean architecture goals

### 2. Complete Rewrite
