## Delegation Patterns

### Systematic Delegation Matrix

| Agent | Delegates To | Receives From | Collaboration Pattern |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| database-specialist | performance-engineer | performance-engineer, infrastructure-specialist | Query optimization → Performance validation |
| ml-orchestrator | performance-engineer, infrastructure-specialist | data-pipeline-specialist | ML training → Performance tuning → Infrastructure scaling |
| performance-engineer | database-specialist, ml-orchestrator | All agents | Cross-cutting performance analysis with specialized optimization |
| security-architect | infrastructure-specialist | None | Policy definition → Tool deployment |
| infrastructure-specialist | database-specialist | security-architect, performance-engineer | Infrastructure setup → Database optimization |

### Delegation Examples

**Complex Performance Issue:**
1. `performance-engineer` identifies database bottleneck
2. Delegates to `database-specialist` for query optimization
3. `database-specialist` optimizes queries and indexes
4. `performance-engineer` validates end-to-end performance improvement

**ML Model Deployment:**
1. `ml-orchestrator` optimizes model training
2. Delegates to `infrastructure-specialist` for deployment infrastructure
3. `infrastructure-specialist` sets up container orchestration
4. Delegates to `security-architect` for security hardening
5. `security-architect` provides security policies and requirements

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Agent

**Database Issues:**
- Slow queries → `database-specialist`
- Database performance monitoring → `performance-engineer` → delegates to `database-specialist`
- Schema migrations → `database-specialist`

**ML/Analytics:**
- Model training optimization → `ml-orchestrator`
- Feature engineering → `ml-orchestrator`
- ML pipeline performance → `performance-engineer` → delegates to `ml-orchestrator`

**Performance Problems:**
- API slow response → `performance-engineer`
- System bottlenecks → `performance-engineer`
- Caching optimization → `performance-engineer`

**Security Concerns:**
- Authentication review → `security-architect`
- Vulnerability assessment → `security-architect`
- Security tool deployment → `infrastructure-specialist` (receives requirements from `security-architect`)

**Infrastructure Tasks:**
- Container setup → `infrastructure-specialist`
- CI/CD optimization → `infrastructure-specialist`
- Environment configuration → `infrastructure-specialist`

### Task Complexity Guidelines

**Simple Tasks (Single Agent):**
- Direct domain expertise required
- No cross-cutting concerns
- Single technology stack

**Medium Tasks (Agent + Delegation):**
- Requires coordination between 2 domains
- Performance validation needed
- Infrastructure deployment required

**Complex Tasks (Multi-Agent Orchestration):**
- Cross-cutting architectural changes
- Security + Performance + Infrastructure
- Full-stack optimization requirements

## Best Practices

### 1. Effective Agent Selection

**✅ Good Practices:**
- Use the most specific agent for the primary task
- Let agents delegate naturally based on their expertise
- Trust agent role boundaries and delegation patterns

**❌ Anti-Patterns:**
- Using `performance-engineer` for database-specific optimization (should delegate to `database-specialist`)
- Using `infrastructure-specialist` for security policy design (should receive from `security-architect`)
- Bypassing delegation by manually specifying multiple agents

### 2. Task Description Best Practices

**✅ Effective Task Descriptions:**
```
"Optimize the PostgreSQL query in the analytics dashboard that's causing the user metrics endpoint to respond slowly"
→ `performance-engineer` → delegates to `database-specialist`
```

```
"Set up testcontainers for real PostgreSQL integration testing in our CI pipeline"
→ `infrastructure-specialist` → delegates to `database-specialist` for schema setup
```

**❌ Ineffective Task Descriptions:**
```
"Fix the slow database" (too vague)
"Use database-specialist to optimize performance" (manual agent specification)
```

### 3. Project-Specific Patterns

**APES Database Architecture:**
- Always specify PostgreSQL version 15+ for new work
- Reference custom SQL migration system (not Alembic)
- Leverage JSONB optimization features
- Use MCP user permissions for controlled access

**ML Pipeline Integration:**
- Reference the decomposed ML architecture (5 services)
- Use model registry aliases (@champion, @production, @challenger)
- Leverage advanced ML features (context-aware learning)
- Consider real behavior testing for ML validations

**Performance Standards:**
- Target P95 response times <100ms
- Achieve >80% cache hit rates (96.67% achieved)
- Maintain <2ms critical path response times
- Use SLO monitoring for performance validation

### 4. Architectural Compliance

**Clean Architecture Adherence:**
- Repository patterns with protocol-based DI
- No direct database imports in business logic
- Service facades for unified interfaces
- Zero god objects (classes >500 lines prohibited)

**Real Behavior Testing:**
- Use testcontainers for integration tests
- No mocks for external services
- Validate actual behavior, not mock behavior
- Container orchestration for test isolation

## Performance Optimization

### Agent Response Time Optimization

**Current Performance Benchmarks:**
- Average response time: <100ms
- Quality score target: >85/100
- Success rate target: >95%
- Boundary compliance: 100%

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Parallel Tool Execution:**
   - Batch Read/Grep/Glob calls simultaneously
   - Use multi-tool responses for 3-10x performance improvement
   - Default to parallel unless sequential dependencies exist

2. **Efficient Delegation:**
   - Single delegation per expertise domain
   - Avoid delegation chains >2 levels
   - Use facade patterns for complex coordination

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - L1 Memory cache: <1ms response
   - L2 Redis cache: <10ms response
   - L3 Database cache: <50ms response
   - 96.67% hit rate achieved

### Performance Monitoring

**Agent Metrics Tracking:**
```bash
# View agent performance dashboard
python3 .claude/scripts/agent-performance-dashboard.py --days 7

# Monitor real-time agent usage
python3 .claude/scripts/agent-metrics-tracker.py report

# Run comprehensive validation
python3 .claude/scripts/agent-validation-suite.py --verbose
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Agent Selection Confusion**

*Problem:* Unsure which agent to use for a cross-cutting task
*Solution:* Start with the primary domain agent, let delegation handle secondary concerns

*Example:* 
- Task: "Database query is slow" 
- Primary: Database concern → `database-specialist`
- Secondary: Performance validation → automatic delegation to `performance-engineer`

**2. Delegation Not Working**

*Problem:* Agent not delegating when expected
*Solution:* Check role boundaries and delegation patterns

*Diagnostics:*
```bash
# Check agent boundaries and delegation patterns
python3 .claude/scripts/agent-validation-suite.py --agent performance-engineer --verbose
```

**3. Performance Issues**

*Problem:* Agent responses are slow
*Solution:* Check system performance and optimization opportunities

*Diagnostics:*
```bash
# Generate performance report
python3 .claude/scripts/agent-performance-dashboard.py --format json --output performance_report.json
```

**4. Quality Score Low**

*Problem:* Agent effectiveness below 85/100 threshold
*Solution:* Review task complexity and agent configuration

*Investigation:*
- Check task description clarity
- Validate agent role boundaries
- Review delegation patterns
- Consider task complexity reduction

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify Primary Domain:** Determine the main technical concern
2. **Select Primary Agent:** Choose the agent with primary domain expertise
3. **Trust Delegation:** Allow natural delegation to occur
4. **Monitor Performance:** Use metrics dashboard for optimization
5. **Validate Results:** Run validation suite for quality assurance

## Integration Patterns

      {"matcher": "Edit", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/scripts/type-safety-validator.py"}]},
      {"matcher": "Task", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/scripts/agent-metrics-tracker.py monitor"}]}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Development Workflow Integration

**Recommended Development Flow:**
1. **Analysis Phase:** Use appropriate domain agent for investigation
2. **Implementation Phase:** Let agents delegate for cross-domain concerns
3. **Validation Phase:** Use validation suite for quality assurance
4. **Monitoring Phase:** Track agent effectiveness and optimization opportunities
