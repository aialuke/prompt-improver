# ADR-003: Connection Manager Consolidation

## Status
**Accepted** - Implemented in Phase 4 Refactoring

## Context
The APES system had evolved to contain 5 separate connection management systems, each addressing different aspects of database connectivity but creating significant complexity and maintenance overhead:

### Existing Connection Managers
1. **HAConnectionManager**: High availability and failover capabilities
2. **UnifiedConnectionManager**: Multi-mode access control and optimization  
3. **DatabaseManager**: Synchronous database operations (16 usage locations)
4. **DatabaseSessionManager**: Modern async SQLAlchemy 2.0 operations
5. **RegistryManager**: SQLAlchemy registry management and conflict resolution

### Problems Identified
- **Fragmented Architecture**: Different parts of the system used different managers
- **Code Duplication**: Similar connection logic implemented multiple times
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Each manager had different error patterns
- **Performance Overhead**: Multiple connection pools and initialization paths
- **Testing Complexity**: Difficult to mock and test different connection strategies
- **Configuration Sprawl**: Connection settings scattered across multiple config files
- **Circular Dependencies**: Managers often depended on each other

### Usage Analysis
```

```

## Decision
We will implement a **Unified Connection Manager V2** that consolidates all connection management functionality into a single, protocol-based system:

### Core Architecture

#### 1. Protocol-Based Design
```python
class ConnectionManagerProtocol(Protocol):
    """Unified interface for all connection management"""
    
    async def get_connection(
        self, 
        mode: ConnectionMode = ConnectionMode.READ_WRITE,
        **kwargs
    ) -> AsyncContextManager[Any]:
        """Get connection with specified access mode"""
        ...
    
    async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Perform comprehensive health check"""
        ...
    
    async def close(self) -> None:
        """Clean shutdown of all connections"""
        ...
```

#### 2. Composition-Based Implementation
```python
class UnifiedConnectionManagerV2:
    """Consolidates all connection management features"""
    
    def __init__(self, config: DatabaseConfig):
        # Compose capabilities from specialized components
        self._pool_manager = ConnectionPoolManager(config)
        self._ha_manager = HighAvailabilityManager(config)
        self._health_monitor = ConnectionHealthMonitor()
        self._registry_manager = SQLAlchemyRegistryManager()
        self._mode_controller = AccessModeController()
```

#### 3. Feature Integration Strategy

##### High Availability Features
- **Automatic Failover**: Seamless primary/replica switching
- **Connection Health Monitoring**: Continuous connection validation
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry strategies with backoff

##### Performance Optimization
- **Advanced Connection Pooling**: Dynamic pool sizing and optimization
- **Mode-Based Access Control**: Read-only, read-write, batch, transactional modes
- **Connection Reuse**: Intelligent connection lifecycle management
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track connection usage and performance metrics

##### Modern Async Support
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Integration**: Full async/await support
- **Context Manager Interface**: Clean resource management
- **Concurrent Access**: Safe multi-threaded/async usage
- **Streaming Results**: Efficient handling of large result sets

    def __init__(self, unified_manager: UnifiedConnectionManagerV2):
        self._manager = unified_manager
        warnings.warn(
            "DatabaseManager is deprecated. Use UnifiedConnectionManagerV2",
            DeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2
        )
    
    def get_session(self) -> Session:
        """Legacy sync session interface"""
        return self._manager.get_sync_session()
    
    async def get_async_session(self) -> AsyncSession:
        """Legacy async session interface"""  
        async with self._manager.get_connection() as conn:
            return conn.session
```
