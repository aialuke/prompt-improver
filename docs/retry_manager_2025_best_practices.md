## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Classification System
```python
# Comprehensive error mapping with severity levels
ERROR_MAPPINGS = {
    psycopg_errors.OperationalError: (ErrorCategory.CONNECTION, ErrorSeverity.HIGH),
    psycopg_errors.QueryCanceled: (ErrorCategory.TIMEOUT, ErrorSeverity.MEDIUM),
    psycopg_errors.DeadlockDetected: (ErrorCategory.TRANSIENT, ErrorSeverity.MEDIUM),
    # ... additional mappings
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
- **Failure Threshold**: Configurable failure count before opening circuit
- **Recovery Timeout**: Time-based recovery with exponential backoff
- **Success Threshold**: Required successful operations to close circuit
- **State Persistence**: Circuit breaker state tracking across operations

### Retry Configuration
- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable multiplier and jitter for retry delays
- **Maximum Attempts**: Configurable retry limits per operation type
- **Timeout Management**: Per-operation timeout configuration
- **Error Type Filtering**: Selective retry based on error classification

## Integration Verification

### Real Behavior Testing
✅ **No Mock Objects**: All tests use real behavior without mocks
✅ **Actual Database Simulation**: Realistic failure patterns and recovery scenarios
✅ **Circuit Breaker Validation**: Real circuit breaker state transitions
✅ **Orchestrator Integration**: Full end-to-end integration testing

### Performance Characteristics
- **Retry Latency**: Sub-second retry operations with exponential backoff
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory overhead for circuit breaker state
- **CPU Optimization**: Efficient error classification and retry logic
- **Scalability**: Support for concurrent operations and multiple database connections

## Security Considerations

### 2025 Security Best Practices
