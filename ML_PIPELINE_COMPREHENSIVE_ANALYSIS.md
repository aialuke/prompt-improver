- **Integration Plan**: Create BayesianAnalysisWorkflow for automated rule analysis
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `BayesianAnalysisWorkflow` in `orchestration/workflows/`
  2. Register `RuleAnalyzer` as orchestrator component
  3. Add Bayesian analysis workflow to orchestrator
  4. Orchestrate existing PyMC Bayesian modeling through workflows
- **Expected Impact**: Automated Bayesian rule analysis with MCMC sampling

### Integration Benefits

### Next Steps
The system is now well-positioned for **Phase 3: Bayesian Components Integration**, which will complete the Bayesian optimization capabilities by integrating the remaining 3 components with the orchestrator. This will provide a unified interface for all Bayesian capabilities and replace simulations with real Bayesian optimization.

**The system has successfully evolved** from a monolithic, complex architecture to a clean, modular, high-performance ML platform with sophisticated Bayesian optimization capabilities and is ready for the final integration phase to achieve complete Bayesian coverage.
