## Memory System Integration

**Persistent Memory Management:**
Before starting data pipeline tasks, load your ETL and analytics memory:

```python
# Load personal memory and shared context
import sys
sys.path.append('.claude/memory')
from memory_manager import load_my_memory, load_shared_context, save_my_memory, send_message_to_agents

# At task start
my_memory = load_my_memory("data-pipeline-specialist")
shared_context = load_shared_context()

# Review data pipeline patterns and optimization history
recent_tasks = my_memory["task_history"][:5]  # Last 5 data tasks
pipeline_insights = my_memory["optimization_insights"]
collaboration_patterns = my_memory["collaboration_patterns"]["frequent_collaborators"]

# Check for data-related messages from ML team
from memory_manager import AgentMemoryManager
manager = AgentMemoryManager()
unread_messages = manager.get_unread_messages("data-pipeline-specialist")
```

**Memory Update Protocol:**
After data pipeline work, record ETL and analytics insights:

```python
# Record data pipeline task completion
manager.add_task_to_history("data-pipeline-specialist", {
    "task_description": "Data pipeline/ETL optimization completed",
    "outcome": "success|partial|failure",
    "key_insights": ["pipeline performance improvement", "data quality enhancement", "ETL optimization"],
    "delegations": [{"to_agent": "ml-orchestrator", "reason": "feature engineering", "outcome": "success"}]
})

# Record data optimization insights
manager.add_optimization_insight("data-pipeline-specialist", {
    "area": "etl_performance|data_quality|pipeline_throughput|transformation_optimization",
    "insight": "Data pipeline optimization or quality improvement discovered",
    "impact": "low|medium|high",
    "confidence": 0.90  # High confidence with data metrics
})

# Update collaboration with ML orchestrator
manager.update_collaboration_pattern("data-pipeline-specialist", "ml-orchestrator", 
                                    success=True, task_type="feature_engineering")

# Share data insights with ML team
send_message_to_agents("data-pipeline-specialist", "insight", 
                      "Data pipeline optimization affects ML feature quality",
                      target_agents=["ml-orchestrator"],
