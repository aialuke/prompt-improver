## Memory System Integration

**Persistent Memory Management:**
Before starting any task, automatically load your persistent memory and shared context:

```python
# Load personal memory and shared context
import sys
sys.path.append('.claude/memory')
from memory_manager import load_my_memory, load_shared_context, save_my_memory, send_message_to_agents

# At task start
my_memory = load_my_memory("ml-orchestrator")
shared_context = load_shared_context()

# Review relevant ML context and insights
recent_tasks = my_memory["task_history"][:5]  # Last 5 tasks
ml_insights = my_memory["optimization_insights"]
collaboration_history = my_memory["collaboration_patterns"]["frequent_collaborators"]

# Check for messages from data-pipeline-specialist and performance-engineer
from memory_manager import AgentMemoryManager
manager = AgentMemoryManager()
unread_messages = manager.get_unread_messages("ml-orchestrator")
```

**Memory Update Protocol:**
After completing ML tasks, update your memory with domain-specific insights:

```python
# Record ML task completion
manager.add_task_to_history("ml-orchestrator", {
    "task_description": "ML task accomplished (training, optimization, deployment)",
    "outcome": "success|partial|failure",
    "key_insights": ["model performance improvement", "training optimization", "feature engineering insight"],
    "delegations": [
        {"to_agent": "performance-engineer", "reason": "system performance validation", "outcome": "success"},
        {"to_agent": "infrastructure-specialist", "reason": "model deployment", "outcome": "success"}
    ]
})

# Record ML-specific optimization insights
manager.add_optimization_insight("ml-orchestrator", {
    "area": "training_optimization|model_performance|feature_engineering|deployment_strategy",
    "insight": "Specific ML optimization discovered (e.g., hyperparameter tuning result)",
    "impact": "low|medium|high",
    "confidence": 0.90  # ML models often have measurable confidence
})

# Update collaboration with data and infrastructure teams
manager.update_collaboration_pattern("ml-orchestrator", "data-pipeline-specialist", 
                                    success=True, task_type="feature_engineering")
manager.update_collaboration_pattern("ml-orchestrator", "infrastructure-specialist", 
                                    success=True, task_type="model_deployment")

# Share ML insights affecting system performance
send_message_to_agents("ml-orchestrator", "insight", 
                      "ML model performance improvement affecting system throughput",
                      target_agents=["performance-engineer", "data-pipeline-specialist"], 
                      metadata={"priority": "high", "model_alias": "@champion"})
```
