# Ruff Review Report

## Findings and Proposed Configuration

Here are the key findings and the proposed Ruff configuration to address them:

- **Findings**:
  - Common violations: Unsorted imports, unused imports, and lack of type annotations.
  - The current configuration focuses on performance, security, coding style, and modern Python syntax.

- **Proposed Ruff Configuration**:
  - Aimed at reducing import and type annotation violations.
  - Includes security checks and modern Python practices.
  - Preview mode enabled for the latest features.

## Violation Metrics

Here are the top 5 violation counts observed in the codebase:

1. **UP006**: Non-pep585-annotation - 1560 instances
2. **F401**: Unused-import - 556 instances
3. **UP045**: Non-pep604-annotation-optional - 368 instances
4. **I001**: Unsorted-imports - 233 instances
5. **UP035**: Deprecated-import - 226 instances

## Migration Guidelines

1. **Configuration**:
   - Migrate existing configuration from `black`, `flake8`, and `isort` to Ruff.
   - Use `pyproject.toml` for a unified configuration.

2. **CI Updates**:
   - Integrate Ruff into CI pipelines, replacing redundant tools.
   - Enforce a zero-tolerance policy for Ruff errors.

3. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Configure Ruff to run with fixable rules.
   - Ensure hooks for security-specific checks.

## Checklist for Gradual Adoption

- [ ] Verify current configuration with the proposed Ruff settings in a separate branch.
- [ ] Run Ruff checks on all major sections of the codebase.
- [ ] Update the CI/CD pipeline with new Ruff checks and remove old linting tools.
- [ ] Gradually enforce stricter rules over two release cycles.
- [ ] Monitor the Ruff error metrics using integrated Prometheus metrics.
