# INTEGRATION MATRIX

## MCP → Traditional Rule Triggers

**After MCP SEARCH WORKFLOW completes** → **ALWAYS trigger MINIMAL COMPLEXITY PRINCIPLE:**
- Use MCP insights to refine search keywords
- Apply context7 patterns to inform decision matrix
- Reference memory findings in complexity evaluation
- **Apply simplicity research to guide approach selection**

**After MINIMAL COMPLEXITY searches** → **ALWAYS apply MCP IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS:**
- Store complexity decision in memory
- Use context7 for chosen approach implementation
- Apply sequential thinking for multi-step execution
- **Store simplicity decisions and anti-patterns avoided in memory**

**During EVIDENCE ENUMERATION** → **ALWAYS reference MCP findings:**
- Include MCP search results in evidence format
- Cross-reference memory patterns with current findings
- Validate claims against context7 best practices
- **Include YAGNI/KISS/DRY principle validation in evidence**

## Traditional → MCP Integration Triggers

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION RULE findings** → **ALWAYS update MCP memory:**
- Store verification decisions for future reference
- Create entities for deletion patterns
- Record rationale for preservation decisions

**PRE-ACTION VERIFICATION unclear scope** → **ALWAYS use MCP sequential thinking:**
- Break down ambiguous requests systematically
- Reference memory for similar clarification patterns
- Apply context7 research for domain-specific understanding
- **Use extended thinking to find simplest interpretation of requirements**

## Cross-Reference Commands

**In MCP rules, always reference:**
```bash
# Before proceeding to traditional search:
echo "Applying MCP insights and simplicity research to MINIMAL COMPLEXITY PRINCIPLE search patterns"

# After MCP completion:
echo "Triggering EVIDENCE ENUMERATION with MCP findings and YAGNI/KISS/DRY validation integrated"
```

**In traditional rules, always reference:**
```bash  
# Before code actions:
echo "Integrating with MCP IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS workflow and simplicity principles"

# After verification:
echo "Storing results and simplicity decisions in MCP memory for institutional knowledge"
```
