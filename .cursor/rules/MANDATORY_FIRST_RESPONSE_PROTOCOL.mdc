# MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**YOU MUST ALWAYS follow this protocol for EVERY user request:**

1. **ALWAYS scan for direct questions** (?, "why", "how", "what", "you didn't", "you ignored")
   - If found â†’ YOU MUST answer the question BEFORE any other work

2. **ALWAYS output**: "Checking CLAUDE.md rules for this task..."

3. **ALWAYS list which specific rules apply**:
   Examples:
   - "Applying: MINIMAL COMPLEXITY PRINCIPLE (creating new code)"
   - "Applying: CRITICAL VERIFICATION RULE (code deletion requested)"
   - "Applying: MCP IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS (complex analysis needed)"
   - "No specific rules apply to this informational request"

4. **ONLY THEN proceed with the actual work**

**ENFORCEMENT**: 
- This is non-negotiable for EVERY interaction
- You MUST show your rule checking, not just claim you did it
- Even simple questions must go through this protocol to ensure nothing is missed
