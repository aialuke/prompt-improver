# MCP Rule Application Server Implementation PRD

## Executive Summary

Implement a production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) Rule Application Server that provides external AI agents with optimized prompt enhancement capabilities. The server focuses exclusively on rule application with <200ms response times, maintaining strict architectural separation from CLI training operations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation Strengths
- FastMCP-based server with stdio transport at `src/prompt_improver/mcp_server/mcp_server.py`
- Complete database schema with rule_performance, rule_metadata, and rule_combinations tables
- Production-ready JWT authentication system in `src/prompt_improver/security/authentication.py`
- Advanced Redis caching implementation with circuit breaker pattern
- Comprehensive performance monitoring and health check endpoints
- 20+ existing MCP tools including core `improve_prompt` functionality

### Critical Implementation Gaps
- Missing RuleCombinations SQLModel class for database ORM operations
- ML training tools present in MCP server (violates architectural separation)
- Missing PromptImprovementSession model for feedback collection
- No Docker containerization configuration
- Missing MCP server configuration in .mcp.json
- No database permission isolation (mcp_server_user)
- Missing advanced rule combination optimization tools

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 0: Environment & Configuration Setup
- Create APES MCP server configuration in .mcp.json
- Add unified MCP environment variables to .env.example
- Create dedicated MCP database user with limited permissions
- Implement feedback infrastructure with PromptImprovementSession table
- Set up Docker configuration for production deployment

### Phase 1: Unified Architecture & Security Implementation
- Remove ML training tools from MCP server (5 specific tools)
- Implement unified database connection pool for mixed read/write workload
- Add direct feedback collection using FastAPI BackgroundTasks
- Implement intelligent rule selection algorithm with multi-criteria scoring
- Add JWT-based authentication integration for MCP server
- Implement OWASP 2025-compliant input validation and sanitization
- Configure sliding window rate limiting with burst handling

### Phase 2: Rule Application Optimization
- Leverage existing MultiLevelCache infrastructure for rule optimization
- Implement L1 cache (1000 rules, 64MB, <1ms access) and L2 Redis cache
- Create specialized tools for AI development integration
- Add performance optimization with <200ms SLA enforcement
- Implement comprehensive logging with performance metadata

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Implement advanced rule application testing with real database connections
- Add security validation testing (JWT, rate limiting, input validation)
- Perform production readiness testing with 50+ concurrent clients
- Validate architectural separation and read-only database access
- Complete integration testing with external MCP clients

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production Deployment
- Implement multi-criteria rule scoring with weighted algorithms
- Add specialized Claude Code and Augment Code integration tools
- Create production Docker configuration and health monitoring
- Implement advanced caching strategies and performance optimization
- Complete documentation and operations handoff

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- <200ms response time for 95th percentile including feedback collection
- <1ms L1 cache access time (in-memory hash map)
- 1-10ms L2 Redis cache access time
- 10-50ms database query time with 150ms timeout protection

### Scalability Requirements
- Support 50+ concurrent MCP clients with stable performance
- >90% cache hit rate across L1+L2 levels
- >95% feedback collection success rate
- 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation under load

### Security Standards
- OWASP 2025-compliant input validation with injection detection
- JWT authentication for all external agent access
- Database permission isolation (read rules, write feedback only)
- Rate limiting: 60 requests/minute basic, 300 professional, 1000+ enterprise

## Database Schema Requirements

### Required Tables
- rule_performance (existing - read-only access)
- rule_metadata (existing - read-only access) 
- rule_combinations (existing - read-only access)
- prompt_improvement_sessions (new - write access only)

### Permission Model
- Create mcp_server_user with controlled database permissions
- Read-only access to all rule tables
- Write access only to feedback tables
- Explicit denial of write access to rule tables (fail-safe)

## Architecture Principles

### Clean Modern Implementation
- Python 3.12+ with async/await throughout
- FastAPI with async database sessions
- No legacy compatibility layers or deprecated patterns
- Modern async patterns with proper error handling

### Real Behavior Testing Strategy
- All tests use real PostgreSQL connections, no mocked database calls
- Test actual MCP server endpoints with real HTTP requests
- End-to-end testing with live Redis cache and database connections
- Performance testing with actual response time measurements
- Security testing with real JWT tokens and rate limiting validation

### Progressive Documentation Updates  
- Update MCP_ROADMAP.md status at each phase completion
- Document actual vs planned timelines in roadmap
- Record and resolve implementation blockers directly in roadmap
- Update success criteria with measured results, not estimates

## Success Criteria

### Implementation Success Metrics
- 0 ML training tools remaining in MCP server
- Database permission-based security enforced
- <200ms response time for 95th percentile maintained
- >90% cache hit rate across L1+L2 levels
- >95% feedback collection success rate
- JWT authentication operational for all external agents
- OWASP-compliant security validation passed

### Production Readiness Metrics
- 50+ concurrent clients supported with stable performance
- 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation under load
- Feedback data integrated with ML training pipeline within 24 hours
- Security penetration testing passed
- Complete documentation and handoff to operations team
