### Repository Pattern Integration
- **Clean data access** through SessionManagerProtocol
- **No direct database imports** in business logic
- **Transaction management** handled by repository layer
- **Connection lifecycle** managed by session manager

## Backward Compatibility

### API Compatibility
The new architecture maintains **100% API compatibility**:

```python
# Original interface (still works)
monitor = DatabaseHealthMonitor()
metrics = await monitor.collect_comprehensive_metrics()
pool_health = await monitor.get_connection_pool_health_summary()
query_analysis = await monitor.analyze_query_performance()

# New interface (recommended)
service = DatabaseHealthService(session_manager)
metrics = await service.collect_comprehensive_metrics()
pool_health = await service.get_connection_pool_health_summary()
query_analysis = await service.analyze_query_performance()
```

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Use new services with existing interfaces (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually adopt focused service interfaces
3. **Phase 3**: Deprecate original monolithic monitor
4. **Phase 4**: Remove deprecated code (future)
