- **Session Management**: ✅ CONSOLIDATED - Single session factory pattern
- **Configuration**: ✅ STANDARDIZED - Unified database configuration via AppConfig

### ⚠️ REMAINING CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES

**1. Configuration Validation Pattern** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **File**: `src/prompt_improver/core/config_validator.py:214`
- **Pattern**: Direct asyncpg usage for connectivity testing
- **Code**: `conn = await asyncpg.connect(conn_string, timeout=timeout)`
- **Impact**: Bypasses UnifiedConnectionManager health monitoring
- **Consolidation**: Route through UnifiedConnectionManager health check methods

**2. Setup and Migration Scripts** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Files**: 
  - `src/prompt_improver/core/setup/initializer.py` (lines 256, 401)
  - `src/prompt_improver/core/setup/migration.py` (lines 462, 843)
- **Pattern**: Direct database commands for setup/migration operations
- **Justification**: Legitimate use case for direct access during system initialization
- **Recommendation**: Maintain current pattern with documentation

**3. Test Infrastructure Patterns** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Files**:
  - `tests/conftest.py` (test database creation)
  - `tests/database_helpers.py` (test utilities)
  - `tests/performance/direct_asyncpg_performance_test.py`
- **Pattern**: Direct asyncpg for test database management
- **Justification**: Test isolation requires independent database connections
- **Recommendation**: Maintain current pattern for test infrastructure

**4. Health Monitoring Integration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **File**: `src/prompt_improver/database/health/database_health_monitor.py`
- **Status**: Uses UnifiedConnectionManager but could leverage more health features
- **Opportunity**: Enhanced integration with UnifiedConnectionManager health metrics
- **Impact**: Improved monitoring consolidation

**5. MCP Server Integration** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **File**: `src/prompt_improver/mcp_server/server.py:1331`
- **Status**: ✅ ALREADY USING UnifiedConnectionManager
- **Pattern**: Proper usage of `connection_manager.get_async_session()`
- **Assessment**: No consolidation needed - correctly implemented

**6. CLI Training System** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **File**: `src/prompt_improver/cli/core/training_system_manager.py:487`
- **Status**: ✅ ALREADY USING UnifiedConnectionManager
- **Pattern**: Proper usage of `get_sessionmanager()`
- **Assessment**: No consolidation needed - correctly implemented

## 🔍 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

### UnifiedConnectionManager Architecture Assessment

**✅ ADVANCED FEATURES (Exceeding 2025 Standards)**:
1. **Auto-Scaling Connection Management**: Dynamic pool scaling (5-100 connections)
2. **Mode-Based Optimization**: MCP_SERVER, ML_TRAINING, HIGH_AVAILABILITY modes
3. **Circuit Breaker Resilience**: Configurable failure thresholds
4. **Multi-Level Cache Integration**: L1/L2/L3 caching with intelligent warming
5. **HA Pool Support**: Primary/replica pool management with automatic failover

**✅ 2025 COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED**:
1. **Pool Pre-Ping**: ✅ Implemented (`pool_pre_ping=True`)
2. **Connection Recycling**: ✅ Implemented (`pool_recycle=3600`)
3. **Async-Only Operations**: ✅ Full async implementation
4. **Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0**: ✅ Complete migration

### Remaining Pattern Analysis

**Pattern 1: Configuration Validation** (6 lines of code)
```python
# Current: Direct asyncpg usage
conn = await asyncpg.connect(conn_string, timeout=timeout)
await conn.fetchval("SELECT 1")
await conn.close()

# Recommended: Use UnifiedConnectionManager
health_status = await unified_manager.health_check()
```

**Pattern 2: Setup Scripts** (Legitimate direct access)
```python
# Current: Direct database commands for setup
process = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("createdb", "apes_db")

# Assessment: Appropriate for system initialization
```

**Consolidation Complexity**: LOW
- Most patterns are either already consolidated or have legitimate reasons for direct access
- Remaining opportunities are small-scale and low-impact
- Primary consolidation work has been successfully completed
