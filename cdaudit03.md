# Comprehensive Architecture Audit (cdaudit03)

## Scope and Methodology

- Examined entire repository (`prompt-improver`) focusing on Python source code under `src/`.
- Counted **30** Python files (`find src -name "*.py" | wc -l`).
- Inspected directory structure and sampled high-complexity files.
- Captured line counts and representative snippets for evidence.

## Key Findings (with evidence)

1. **Monolithic CLI module violates separation of concerns**

   [Finding]: `cli.py` is **1,963 lines** and mixes service orchestration, database access, ML training, backup, monitoring, and security commands. (Scope: 1/30 files)

   Evidence:

   ```1:15:src/prompt_improver/cli.py
   import asyncio
   import subprocess
   import sys
   ...
   from prompt_improver.database import get_session
   ```

   ```200:215:src/prompt_improver/cli.py
   @app.command()
   def train(
       real_data_priority: bool = typer.Option(True, "--real-data-priority/--no-priority", help="Prioritize real data"),
       ...
   ```

   **Recommendation**: Extract each major functional area into its own module under `prompt_improver/cli/commands/`, leaving `cli.py` as a thin orchestrator.

2. **Oversized service modules reduce maintainability**

   [Finding]:
   - `advanced_pattern_discovery.py` â€“ **1,144 lines**
   - `prompt_improvement.py` â€“ **905 lines**
   - `monitoring.py` â€“ **721 lines** (Scope: 3/30 files)

   Evidence:

   ```1:15:src/prompt_improver/services/advanced_pattern_discovery.py
   """Advanced Pattern Discovery Service for Phase 4 ML Enhancement & Discovery"""
   ...
   ```

   **Recommendation**: Split these into smaller, cohesive modules (e.g., `pattern_mining`, `ml_training`, `monitoring`) and introduce shared utilities where appropriate.

3. **Ambiguous directory naming (`service/` vs `services/`) creates confusion**

   [Finding]: Both `src/prompt_improver/service` and `src/prompt_improver/services` exist, each containing business-logic classes. (Scope: 2 directories)

   **Recommendation**: Consolidate into a single `services/` package and create clear sub-packages (`core`, `domain`, `integration`).

4. **Packaging artifacts are committed to source**

   [Finding]: `adaptive_prompt_enhancement_system.egg-info/` resides under `src/`.

   **Recommendation**: Move build artifacts to `dist/` or exclude them via `.gitignore` to keep the source tree clean.

5. **Layering violations: CLI directly accesses DB and domain services**

   [Finding]: `cli.py` calls `get_session()` and `prompt_service.run_ml_optimization` directly within command handlers (lines 200-330).

   **Recommendation**: Introduce an application service layer or faÃ§ade so the CLI remains a presentation layer only.

6. **Limited static typing and interfaces**

   [Finding]: Several large modules (e.g., `_generate_pattern_recommendations` in `advanced_pattern_discovery.py`) lack explicit return-type annotations.

   **Recommendation**: Adopt stricter typing (`mypy`, `ruff --select I,ANN`) and define clear interfaces for service boundaries.

7. **Insufficient test coverage for complexity hotspots**

   [Finding]: No tests reference `AdvancedPatternDiscovery` (`rg "AdvancedPatternDiscovery" tests | wc -l` â†’ 0).

   **Recommendation**: Add unit and integration tests for pattern discovery, monitoring, and ML training logic.

## Ordered Improvement Plan

1. **Modularize CLI commands** (highest impact)
2. **Refactor oversized service modules into cohesive sub-packages**
3. **Merge and clarify `service/` vs `services/` directory structure**
4. **Establish layered architecture (CLI â†’ Application Services â†’ Domain Services â†’ Data/Persistence)**
5. Remove build artifacts from repository and update `.gitignore`
6. Enforce static typing and integrate CI checks (`pre-commit`, `ruff`, `mypy`)
7. Increase unit/integration test coverage, focusing on ML & pattern discovery
8. (Optional) Adopt dependency-injection pattern for easier testing and decoupling
9. (Optional) Generate automated docs with `mkdocs` or Sphinx

### Confidence Assessment

- **Evidence Quality**: medium â€“ representative sampling of large files and directory structure.
- **Methodology Used**: systematic file inspection, line-count metrics, targeted ripgrep searches.
- **Data Source Reliability**: manual inspection & shell commands â€“ reliable for static analysis.
- **Verification Level**: single-source; cross-file dependency graph not fully mapped.
- **Overall Confidence**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM (â‰ˆ 80 %) â€“ further automated analysis would increase certainty.

**Limitations**: Runtime behaviours and dynamic imports were not evaluated; audit focused on static structure and LOC metrics.
